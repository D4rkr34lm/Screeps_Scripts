# Strategy

I think we should start with an initial buildup i.e gathering energy for building streets.
After that we need to calculate the how to layout the room. In that we need to especially consider how to layout streets & extensions
We also need to consider maintenance and colony upkeep, while not creating more screeps than necessary.
Also we need to consider defense, both active as part of our building strategy as well as active by creating military screeps
